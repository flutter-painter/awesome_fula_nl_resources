en	zu	ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.	I-ACE2 iyiphrotheni yolwelwesi ewuhlobo I olunomzila owodwa, enedomeyini yayo esebenza ngama-enzyme echayeke ebusweni bamaseli emaphashini nakwezinye izicubu.	wiki_20:2416	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
en	zu	The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine.	Idomeyini yangaphandle kweseli ye-ACE2 ihlukaniswa ukusuka kudomeyini ye-transmembrane nge-enzyme eyaziwa ngokuthi yi-sheddase, futhi iphrotheni encibilikayo eba khona ikhishelwa egazini futhi ekugcineni iphumela emchamweni.	wiki_20:2417	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028

en	zu	More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.	Ngokuqondile, ukuhlangana kwephrotheni le-spike S1 ye-SARS-CoV ne-SARS-CoV2 kudomeyini eyi-enzyme ye-ACE2 ebusweni bamaseli kuphumela ku-endocytosis nakuhambeni kwakho kokubili igciwane ne-enzyme kuye ku-endosomes ephakathi kwamaseli.	wiki_20:2426	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2	CC_BY-SA_3.0	en_zu_0028
en	zu	This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic.This has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2, in cells, might help in fighting the infection.	Le nqubo yokungena iphinde idinge ukwenza i-S protein lenziwe lisebenze yi-serine protease TMPRSS2, isivimbeli esingaphansi kophenyo lwamanje njengesingaba yikhambi lesifo.
